Collecting Time Series

Collector Component
===================

The Collector component is part of the :ref:`collection layer <Archi_CollectionLayer>`.
It essentially is an application that runs on a device (server, virtual machine, embedded hardware, â€¦) near a data source.
As its name suggests, the Collector component collects time series values either by querying the data source,
observing its environment, or receiving informations from external data sources.

The collector comes with **modules** that support the connection *from* and *to* various types of data source, including
relational databases, Modbus networks, OPC servers, etc. Each module creates one or many agents, that interact
with their environment for actually collecting data points.
Using the collector component therefore consists in choosing and configuring the modules that must be run in order to
collect new observations.

Freshly collected data points are eventually submitted to a component of the :ref:`ingestion layer <Archi_IngestionLayer>`
for processing and storage purposes.
The second task of the user of the collector component is therefore to specify how the collected data stream must be
transmitted to the ingestion layer.

Both collection and transmission configuration are performed by editing a configuration file that is communicated to the
collector when its process is started.

Configuration
-------------

The configuration file of a collector module contains three elements.

- The **buffer** part details how collected data points are temporarily stored before being sent to the ingestion layer.
  The configuration of the buffer should not be modified by the user.
- The **sources** part describes the list of data sources from which data points must be collected. As mentioned above,
  each type of data source is covered by a specific collector component, and each component comes with its own configuration
  schema.
- The **sink** part describes how collected data points should be sent to the ingestion layer. Again, each solution for
  exporting data flows has its own configuration schema.

An example of configuration document is listed below:

.. code-block::

    buffer = {
        host = "localhost"
        port = 5672
        queue_name = "buffer"
        user = "guest"
        password = "guest"
    }

    sources = [
        { configuration for a RDMS connexion },
        { configuration for a Modbus connexion }
    ]

    sink = { sink configuration }



Source Configuration
====================

Each source is identified with the ``type`` attribute. Each type has its own configuration schema.
A source is either a *poll* source or a *drain* source.

Poll sources periodically act (typically by interacting with its environment or an external source) in order to fetch
new data points. These sources are characterized by the time interval separating two consecutive poll rounds.

While the collector tries to respect the specified time interval, the actual inter-round duration between typically varies
depending on unpredictable factors.
If a round takes more time to complete than the specified time interval, the next round will actually start right
after the current one comes to an end.

At any time, at most one round is delayed.
If the delay becomes so important that two rounds or more are awaiting to start, the oldest delayed rounds are cancelled.

On the other hand, drain sources are continuously listening for incoming data points pushed by external data sources, and
transmit new data points as soon as possible.


Poll Sources
------------

All poll sources have a mandatory ``interval`` attribute, which textually represents the expected time interval between
two successive poll rounds.
Format is ``<length><unit>``, where whitespace is allowed before, between, and after the parts.
``length`` must be either a positive integer, or a positive floatting number. ``unit`` must be one of the following:

- ``d``, ``day`` or ``days``
- ``h``, ``hour`` or ``hours``
- ``min``, ``minute`` or ``minutes``
- ``s``, ``second`` or ``seconds``
- ``ms``, ``milli``, ``millisecond`` or ``milliseconds``

Currently, the following source types are supported:

Random Poll Source
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This component randomly generates double values, mostly for testing purpose.
Each generated message contains a single data point associated with the current timestamp.

Mandatory parameters are:

- ``metric``, a list of texts representing the potential metric names to be associated with the message. Each time a
  message is generated, on of the specified metrics will be randomly picked.
- ``tagset``, a dictionary of `(key, value)` that will be added as the message tagset.
  Both keys and values must be textual.

Example of Random Poll configuration:

.. code-block::

    {
        type = "random"
        interval = "1 second"
        metric = [
            "sensor-1", "sensor-2", "sensor-3", "sensor-4", "sensor-5",
            "sensor-6", "sensor-7", "sensor-8", "sensor-9", "sensor-10"
        ]
        tagset = {
            "owner" = "myself",
            "quality" = "good"
        }
    }


Modbus TCP Poll Source
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Modbus TCP Poll component frequently polls a Modbus TCP slave (server) for extracting values from its registers.

The following parameters must be specified:

- ``type`` must be ``poll/modbus/tcp``
- ``interval``, the desired polling interval.
- ``name``, a human friendly name of the slave.
- ``unit_id``, the unit id to transmit with the requests.
- ``max_response_bytes``, the maximum number of bytes a Modbus response can contain. Requests will be sent in order to keep the responses length under this limit. The total response length will be `9 + 2 * registerNumber`. The supported response length depends on the slave device. 
- ``host``, the ip address or host name of the slave.
- ``port``, the port on which the slave is waiting for queries. The standard value is `502`.
- ``output_coils``, the list of coils in the discrete output coils (coil numbers between 1 and 9999; Modbus function 1) to be collected.
- ``input_contacts``, the list of discrete input contacts (coils number between 10001 and 19999; Modbus function 2) to be collected.
- ``holding_registers``, the list of analog holding registers (registers number between 30001 and 39999; Modbus function 3) to be collected.
- ``input_registers``, the list of analog output input registers (registers number between 40001 and 49999; Modbus function 4) to be collected.

The coil and register tables (`output_coils`, `input_contacts`, `input_registers`, `holding_registers`) are polled
in a cyclic fashion, it that order.

Each item in `output_coils` and `input_contacts` describes the properties of a coil as follows:

- ``address``, the coil address as an integer (ex: ``1234``) or an hexadecimal string (ex: ``"04D2"``). Must be a value
  between `0000` and `270E`.
- ``metric``, the id of the metric associated with the coil.
- ``tagset``, a optional dictionary of the dynamic tagset to be reported with each collected value.

The snippet below shows an example of coil description:

.. code-block::

    output_coils = [
        {
            address = 1234,
            metric = "door-is-closed",
            tagset = {
                asset_type = "door"
            }
        },
        {
            address = "04D3",
            metric = "parked-head",
            tagset = {
                asset_type = "drive head",
                computer = "14a284d5-4aa0"
            }
        }
    ]

Each item in ``input_registers`` and ``holding_registers`` describes as the properties of a register as follows:

- ``address``, the register address as an integer (ex: ``1234``) or an hexadecimal string (ex: ``"04D2"``). Should be a value
  between `0000` and `270E`.
- ``metric``, the id of the metric associated with the coil.
- ``tagset``, a optional dictionary of the dynamic tagset to be reported with each collected value.
- ``type``, the type of data stored in the register. It helps the module to properly decode the register, and transmit
  a message in the right format. Must be one of the following value:

  - ``bool16``, a boolean value stored in a single word.
  - ``uint16``, an unsigned integer value, stored as a single word.
  - ``uint32``, an unsigned integer value, stored as two words. The register that follows the addressed one will be used
    to read the value.
  - ``sint16``, a signed integer value, stored as a single word.
  - ``sint32``, a signed integer value, stored as two words. The register that follows the addressed one will be used
    to read the value.
  - ``sfloat32``, a signed floatting number, stored as two words.
    The register that follows the addressed one will be used to read the value.
  - ``enum16``, a categorial value, stored as a single word. The ``values`` property of the register can be used for
    decoding each possible integer as a string.
  - ``charN``, where `N` is a positive integer. Represent a character string stored as `N` words. Each word is decoded
    as a pair of characters, using the `ASCII encoding standard <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII>`_.
- ``byte_order``, a string representing the way bytes are ordered in the register. May be `LOW_BYTE_FIRST` or `HIGH_BYTE_FIRST`. Default is `HIGH_BYTE_FIRST`.
- ``word_order``, a string representing the way words are ordered in multi-register values. May be `LOW_WORD_FIRST` or `HIGH_WORD_FIRST`. Default is `HIGH_WORD_FIRST`.

Numeric (ie, integer and decimal) types can optionally have the following extra parameters:

- ``min_threshold``: a numeric value, below which collected values will automatically be associated with the tag
  ``quality=bad``.
- ``max_threshold``: a numeric value, above which collected values will automatically be associated with the tag
  ``quality=bad``.

Please note that, if the ``min_threshold`` or the ``max_threshold`` parameters are specified, and if the collected
value remains behind the thresholds, this value will automatically be associated with the tag ``quality=good``.

Additionally, The unsigned integer and enumeration types can optionally have the following extra parameters:

- ``mask``, the hexadecimal representation of a binary mask to be applied for limiting the value extraction to the bits
  covered by this mask. It allows, for instance, to represent (and decode) two 8-bit integers in a 16-bit register.

Integer types can optionnally have the following extra parameters:

- ``rank``, a strictly positive integer specifying the decimal rank of the integer unit. The integer value will be divided by `10^rank`, making it a floatting number.

Furthermore, the ``enum16`` type can optionally have the following extra parameters:

- ``values``, a mapping between integers (represented as literal integers or hexadecimal strings) and arbitrary strings.

.. topic:: Register Extended Addresses

    According to the Modbus specifications, the register addresses must be comprised between `0000` and `270E`.
    Extended addresses, ie addresses from `270F` to `FFFF`, are supported by the Modbus module, but it is up to the user
    to ensure such addresses are supported by the queried slave nodes.

.. topic:: Byte and Word Ordering

    The Modbus specification doesn't mention how a register value should be decoded.
    Over time, device constructors proposed contradictory conventions about the bit ordering among a word,
    as well as the word ordering among records combining multiple words.

    Consequently, generic Modbus masters have to deal with any combination of high/low byte first, and high/low word
    first configurations.
	
	`HIGH_BYTE_FIRST` ordering is normally used in Modbus messages, and `HIGH_WORD_FIRST` is more frequently encountered. Using both `HIGH_BYTE_FIRST` and `HIGH_WORD_FIRST` corresponds to the `big endian` representation, while using both `LOW_BYTE_FIRST` and `LOW_WORD_FIRST` corresponds to the `little endian` representation.
	
	
The snippet below shows an example of register description:

.. code-block::

    holding_registers = [
        {
			address = 1
			metric = "pump-temperature"
			type = "sint16"
			rank = 2
			min_threshold = -100
			max_threshold = 100
        }
    ]



Sink Configuration
==================

In the Collector module, the sink is the component that submits extracted data points to the ingestion layer.
Because this layer relies on different technologies, the user has to specify how to connect the sink to an
operating ingestion component.

.. warning::

    Since authentication tokens may be used for altering the state of a TSorage solution, they must be considered
    as secret items that should only be shared with trustworthy entities. Because such a token is stored in the collector
    configuration file, the access to this file should be restricted to only allowed users.

Stdout Sink
-----------

This simple sink prints every individual incoming message to the standard output of the running process.
A message is printed as a single line JSON document. Printed messages are separated by a new line character.

HTTP Sink
---------

The HTTP Sink can communicate with the :ref:`REST HTTP Ingestion module <Ingesting_TS_HTTP_REST>` of the ingestion layer.
Each message is sent using a HTTP POST query, the payload of which is a JSON representation of the message.

For a REST HTTP ingestion service, the following parameters must be specified:

- ``type`` must be set to ``http``.
- ``ip`` is the IP address of the HTTP service.
- ``port`` is the port number the HTTP service is listening to. Default value: ``8080``.
- ``prefix`` the path for the HTTP service.
- ``api_key`` is the token used for authenticating the sender.
  This token will be transmitted with each message submitted to the ingestion component.
  Any incoming message with no token, or a token that does not correspond to an authorized user, will be rejected by the
  ingestion layer. Authentication tokens are managed from the :ref:`User and Access Management <UserManagement>` interface.

Example of HTTP Sink configuration:

.. code-block::

    {
        type = "http"
        ip = "127.0.0.1"
        port = 8080
        prefix= "api/v1/series"
        api_key = "ed1e6666-10f8-4cf5-bed9-610102457aa9"
    }


MQTT Sink
---------

The MQTT Sink can communicate with the :ref:`MQTT ingestion module <Ingesting_TS_MQTT>` of the ingestion layer.
Messages are sent using a MQTT session. The following parameters must be specified:

- ``type`` must be set to ``mqtt``.
- ``ip`` is the IP address of the MQTT broker.
- ``port`` is the port the MQTT broker is listening to. Default value: ``1883``.
- ``channel`` must correspond to the channel used by the MQTT Ingestion module. Default value: ``timeseries``
